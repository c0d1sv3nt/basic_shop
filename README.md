Explanation of the JavaScript Code:

Responsive Navbar:

It selects the .burger and .nav-links elements.
An event listener is added to the burger icon. When clicked, it toggles the active class on the nav-links and the toggle class on the burger to handle the menu display and the burger icon animation.
Optionally, it adds event listeners to each link in the navigation to close the menu when a link is clicked (useful for smaller screens).
"Buy Now" Button:

It selects all elements with the class .buy-btn.
An event listener is added to each "Buy Now" button. When clicked, it retrieves the data-item-name and data-item-price attributes (though we are not using them to pass to the payment page in this basic example) and then navigates the user to the payment.html page. In a real application, you would likely pass the item information to the payment page using local storage or URL parameters.
Payment Form Validation:

It selects the payment form and the input fields and their corresponding error message elements.
An event listener is added to the form's submit event.
event.preventDefault() is used to stop the default form submission behavior.
It then retrieves the values from each input field and performs basic validation:
Card Number: Checks if it's not empty. (More robust validation would involve checking the format and using Luhn's algorithm).
Expiry Date: Checks if it matches the MM/YY format using a regular expression.
CVV: Checks if it's not empty and contains only digits.
Cardholder Name: Checks if it's not empty.
Billing Address: Checks if it's not empty.
If an input is invalid, it displays an error message in the corresponding div and sets isValid to false.
If all inputs are valid (isValid is still true):
It simulates a POST request using the fetch API to the URL 'YOUR_POST_URL_HERE'. You will need to replace this placeholder with the actual URL of your backend server that will process the payment information.
It sets the Content-Type header to application/json and sends the form data as a JSON string in the request body.
It handles the response from the server:
If the response is successful (response.ok), it redirects the user to success.html.
If the response indicates an error, it displays an alert message and logs the error to the console.
It also includes a catch block to handle potential network errors during the fetch request.
Important:

Replace 'YOUR_POST_URL_HERE' in the JavaScript code with the actual API endpoint where you want to send the payment data.
This is basic front-end validation. You should always perform thorough server-side validation and security measures to handle payment information securely.
The "Buy Now" button simply navigates to the payment page. In a real e-commerce scenario, you would need to pass information about the selected item to the payment page (e.g., using local storage, session storage, or URL parameters).
The CSS provides a basic responsive layout. You can customize it further to match your desired design.
